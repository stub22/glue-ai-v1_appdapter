  <comment>OSGi platform dependency wrapper - of dubious value, so far!  This bundle sets up dependencies on specific versions of OSGi common components.
				It doesn&apos;t really work right yet, since the deps are marked &quot;provided&quot; and are not propagated
				to client projects.  You can pretty much ignore this project!. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
