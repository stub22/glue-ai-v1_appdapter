#If in cygwin you will do something like:

cd /cygdrive/p/_prj/s2/appdapter/appdapter_trunk/maven/org.appdapter.bundle.felix.shell

#From Windows prompt, it will be more like:

cd \your\awesome\windows\path

#From there, assuming your JAVA_HOME, M2_HOME, ANT_HOME, and PATH are set up well, you can do:

mvn clean
mvn package
mvn -Prun-on-felix antrun:run

# After success on those, you can then use ant directly to run with a standard felix console,
# using either    run.sh,  run.bat, or, even more directly:

ant -f ant_run.xml -propertyfile target/felix.ant.run.props

Our Maven pom file comes from 
#org.scala-tools.archetypes
#scala-archetype-simple
#1.3
#maven-archetype
