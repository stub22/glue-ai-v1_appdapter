Ekit v0.9h (C)2000-2004 Howard Kistler/hexidec codex
App/Applet for editing and saving HTML in a Java text component.


ABOUT
--------------------------

Ekit is a program & applet that uses the Java 2 libraries to create an HTML
editor. The Ekit standalone also allows for HTML to be loaded and saved, as
well as serialized and saved as an RTF. It is currently an advanced beta,
and most features work fine.

ABOUT LICENSE
--------------------------

Ekit was originally distributed under the GPL license. However, it was brought
to my attention that the GPL license is not suited for programs that link to
non-GPL libraries, such as Ekit does by linking to the Sun Swing library.
Hence, I have changed the licensing on Ekit to the LGPL, which is more
appropriate. This should not impact any Ekit users adversely, as anyone who
was using it before under the GPL can still do so without any conflicts under
the LGPL. In addition, this opens up Ekit for use with more projects which
might contain some proprietary libraries of their own as well. It is my
intention through this change to make Ekit conform better to open source
licensing and to make Ekit more available and accessible to developers and
users, and I think by switching to the LGPL all of these criteria are thus met.

I am aware that releasing a product under the GPL is supposed to be an
"irreversible" process. However, as this product was probably in violation of
the stricter terms of the GPL, this reassignment to LGPL is not a change so
much as a correction of licensing.

NOTE : If you want to use the spellcheck versions, move or delete the basic
versions and rename the spellcheck versions to the basic names. So, for
example, ekitspell.jar should be renamed ekit.jar.


JAZZY SOURCES
--------------------------

Ekit optionally incorporates a modified subset of the Jazzy open source
spellchecker. The root directory of the Jazzy classes is "com/swabunga/spell".
You will find the following subdirectories and sources there. (See the README
file under the "swabunga" directory for more information.)

The "engine" subdirectory contains the basic mechanics of the spellchecker.

Configuration.java
DoubleMeta.java
EditDistance.java
GenericTransformator.java
PropertyConfiguration.java
SpellDictionary.java
Transformator.java
Word.java
configuration.properties

The "dictionary" subdirectory beneath "engine" houses the available
dictionary files. Currently there is only an English dictionary included.

english - English dictionary file

The "event" sudirectory contains the various event classes and functional
methods for the spellchecker.

BasicSpellCheckEvent.java
DocumentWordTokenizer.java
SpellCheckEvent.java
SpellCheckListener.java
SpellChecker.java
StringWordTokenizer.java
WordTokenizer.java

The "swing" subdirectory contains the GUI components and message lists.

JSpellDialog.java
JSpellForm.java
messages.properties
messages_sv.properties


COMPILATION (OPTIONAL)
--------------------------

If you modify the included .java files, or need to recreate the .class files,
use the following commands within the "source" directory to build them. All
commands assume you are at the top of the source tree (the directory containing
the "com" directory). All commands listed are one-line commands as well, though
some are broken to multiple lines in this file due to length. Also note that
the backslash ("\") character should be replaced by the appropriate path
separator for your operating system if it is different.

Unix or Mac OS X users may run the MakeEkit.csh and MakeEkitApplet.csh scripts
from a terminal window. Remember to preface them with "./" when running from
within the code directory.

Windows users may double-click the MakeEkit.bat and MakeEkitApplet.bat batch
files, or execute them from the command line.

Both sets of batch files take an optional command line argument. You can enter
"basic" after the batch file to compile the standard Ekit classes, or enter
"spell" after the batch file to build in the Jazzy spellchecker classes.

For example, here is a standard build of EkitApplet on Unix:

    MakeEkitApplet.csh

    or

    MakeEkitApplet.csh basic

Here is an example of building Ekit with spellchecking on Windows:

    MakeEkit.bat spell

Apache Ant (http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/) users may use the included .ant XML
files to compile and build the Ekit jar files with Ant.

You may manually compile Ekit with the following command:

    Unix/MacOSX  javac com/hexidec/ekit/Ekit.java
    Windows      javac com\hexidec\ekit\Ekit.java
    Apache Ant   ant -buildfile MakeEkit.ant

You may manually compile EkitApplet with the following command:

    Unix/MacOSX  javac com/hexidec/ekit/EkitApplet.java
    Windows      javac com\hexidec\ekit\EkitApplet.java
    Apache Ant   ant -buildfile MakeEkitApplet.ant

Ekit takes no special arguments during compile. The above command assumes your
Java development environment is configured according to minimal standards and
can locate the relevant Java core files properly.

View the .csh or .bat files for the proper syntax to manually create the jar
files under your OS.


EXECUTION (APP)
--------------------------

All users with properly configured systems will be able to launch Ekit by
double-clicking on the "ekit.jar" file. Unix/MacOSX users may lanuch Ekit with
the "RunEkit.csh" script. Windows users may launch Ekit by double-clicking the
batch file "RunEkit.bat".

You may manually execute Ekit from the command line with the following command
from within the directory containing the ekit.jar file:

    java -jar ekit.jar com.hexidec.ekit.Ekit
        [-t/T] [-s/S] [-m/M] [-x/X] [-d/D]
        [-fHTMLfile] [-cCSSfile] [-rRawHTML] [-lLangcode]

Note that your CLASSPATH settings should include the "current directory"
specifier "." for this to work.

The [optional] command line arguments are:

    -t/-T : Show/Hide the ToolBar (Show by default)
    -s/-S : Show/Hide the Source window (Hide by default)
    -m/-M : Show/Omit Menu icons (Show by default)
    -x/-X : Exclusive Edit Mode On/Off (On by default)
    -b/-B : Document is/isn't Base64 encoded (Isn't by default)
    -d/-D : Show/Hide the Debug menu (Hide by default)
    -f    : Load the HTML document specified by HTMLfile
    -c    : Load the CSS stylesheet specified by CSSfile
    -r    : Load the raw HTML string specified by RawHTML
    -l    : Start Ekit in the language specified by Langcode*

[* Langcode is a combination of the 2-letter language and country codes, in the
format "xx_XX", where xx is the language code and XX is the country code. For
example, the Langcode for English/United States is "en_US", English/United
Kingdom is "en_UK", and German/Germany is "de_DE". Note that there must be
a matching "LanguageResources_xx_XX.properties" file in the com/hexidec/ekit
directory for the language you want to use. Missing language files, and
existing language files that may be missing words in use, will take words from
the "LanguageResources.properties" file, which contains default words in
"en_US" encoding marked with a trailing asterisk.]

So, for example, to start Ekit with the ToolBar hidden, the Source window
showing, and pre-load it with the "Home.html" document and "Styles.css" 
stylesheet, you would enter:

    java -jar ekit.jar com.hexidec.ekit.Ekit -T -s -fHome.html -cStyles.css

To start Ekit with a short example HTML document written as a raw string, you
could enter:

    java -jar ekit.jar com.hexidec.ekit.Ekit -r"<HTML><BODY>This is a <B>test
        </B></BODY></HTML>"

To start Ekit with the Italian/Italy language file:

    java -jar ekit.jar com.hexidec.ekit.Ekit -lit_IT

Note that you shouldn't have to specify the language setting if you want Ekit
to run in your native language, provided there is an appropriate language file
in the com/hexidec/ekit directory and your Java environment is configured to
use your language by default.


EXECUTION (APPLET)
--------------------------

Embed the Ekit applet in a web page and view in an appropriate browser.
The jar file should be included in the directory with the web page and
it should also be "visible" to the web server.

The included "EkitAppletDemo.html" page contains the code necessary to
view the applet properly. You may use this as the basis for including
Ekit in your own web pages.

    - source view panel replaced with JTextArea (lighter weight)
    - StyledDocument constructors and setter method
    - optional multiple "themed" toolbars in place of single catch-all toolbar
    - command-line usage options available in Ekit (use -h or -? argument)

NOTE: The following items work in Ekit but not yet in EkitApplet, due to the
applet security model:

    - Insert Image (Images referenced via a URL should work, though)
    - Copy & Paste from system clipboard
    - Access of local files

We are looking into ways to make these features available. The probable
solution will be to obtain a security certificate.
